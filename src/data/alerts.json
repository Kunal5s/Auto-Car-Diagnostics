    "summary": "From the oil pressure light to the battery alert, we cover the top 5 dashboard warning lights that require your immediate attention.",
    "content": "Dashboard warning lights are your car's way of communicating that something is wrong. While some are informational, others signal serious problems that should not be ignored.\n\n1.  **Check Engine Light:** The most infamous light, it can indicate anything from a loose gas cap to a serious engine problem. It's best to get it checked out promptly.\n\n2.  **Oil Pressure Warning Light:** This light looks like an old-fashioned oil can. If it comes on, it means your engine has lost normal oil pressure. Stop the car immediately and check the oil level. Driving with low oil pressure can cause severe engine damage.\n\n3.  **Engine Temperature Warning Light:** Shaped like a thermometer, this light indicates your engine is overheating. Pull over as soon as it's safe and turn off the engine to let it cool down.\n\n4.  **Brake System Warning Light:** This usually appears as the word \"BRAKE\" or an exclamation point in a circle. It could mean the parking brake is on, or there's a serious issue with your braking system, like low brake fluid.\n\n5.  **Battery/Charging System Warning Light:** A battery-shaped icon indicates a problem with the car's electrical system, such as a failing battery, a bad alternator, or a broken serpentine belt.",
